# Road_Lane_Marking_System
Canny Edge detection technique with Hough Transform is used for edge detection.

The generated edges at the road side can be used to find the middle point of the Edges in the pixel space. It can then be used to find the correct orintation of the Differential wheeled robot to steer in the direction to always maintain that midpoint of the edges near the center most pixel. Though the main idea remains to steer and move the robot slow enough to always maintain corrective steering


Resourse: The project uses the resources provided in the video Simulate Self-Driving Cars with Computer Vision & Deep Learning on youtube. The project uses similar technique for the canny edge detection and then Hough trsnform for making the edges in the final Image.
